Improve octree perf?
####################

- Structure as a whole
--Keep all nodes in an array instead of allocating them with new()

- Store even less in Node

- Traversal itself
-- more optimisations possible?
-- stack is quite big
--- do we need to keep intermediary t values?

- Profile code tools?
- More OpenMP fiddling

------------------------------

Improve sparsify
################
- OpenMP
- Better building phase (more memory coherence)

------------------------------

Statistics
- Number of nodes
- Size of octree





-- start testing normals
- use smart pointers
- GPU ray casting?
